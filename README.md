gs-markdown
===========

GetSimple CMS Markdown Plugin - a plugin to enable use of Markdown and Markdown Extra in GetSimple CMS.

[GetSimple CMS][gs](http://get-simple.info/) is a very simple, but powerful CMS. Targeted towards smaller sites (1 - 15 pages), it is also extensible with plugins to be useful as a blogging system as well.

[Markdown][md] and [Mardown Extra][mde] allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML). Markdown was developed to be a human-readable syntax, suitable for plain-text emails. It is used by many applications, including github, stack overflow, and reddit. It is also offered as an option in many other programs.

Integrating Markdown into GetSimple was proven to be rather easy, done with two lines of code by [Zegnat](http://get-simple.info/forum/topic/592/markdown-for-getsimple/).

Installation
============

Installation is similiar to any other plugin. Simple upload the gs-markdown.php and the gs-markdown folder into the plugins folder of your GetSimple CMS installation.

Now, when you edit a page, you will have to click on the Source button in ckeditor in able to directly enter plain text/markdown text. There is an issue that if you edit the page again, most of your line breaks will be missing. 

If you disable ckeditor (Admin -> Settings -> Disable HTML Editor), then all edits will be in markdown and formatting will be preserved.

Future Plans
============

1. Add Markdown Extra
2. Make Plugin configurable
3. Switch between HTML editor on a per-page basis, preferrably on the editor page. (Could be a simple js link).
4. [Implement Markitup Editor](http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/examples/markdown/)
